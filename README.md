# Invalid Static Mesh Remover

This Python script removes invalid static meshes from actors in an Unreal Engine 4 level. This should help to remove the annoying "invalid static mesh for actor" messages that occasionally appear when working with an actor whose mesh is no longer valid because its reference has been deleted. 

## Brief Notes

This script was written in Python 2.7 and should work in UE 4.24 +.

## TODOS

If necessary for future versions of Unreal Engine (4.26 has just been released as of this readme's creation), the script will be ported to Python 3.
Need to add extra code for error handling and reporting to UE4.
